# 2048-Mobile-App-game
A collaborative recreation of a popular mobile game
This game was created based on the "2048" mobile app game. It has been remade from scratch using Java. Once the original 4 by 4 
matrix game was done, our team went further and created an easier 6 by 6 matrix game that allowed beginners to learn the basics.
Then we went further one more time to create a two player mode where people could compete to reach 512 first.
The project was met with resounding success and approval by my high school and various computer science majors.
